<p>A <em>command line</em> is a text-based interface to your computer.  You can think of
it as being similar to the MacOS Finder or Windows Explorer in that it provides
an interface for interacting with programs and other files on your computer;
the main difference, though, is that the command line is entirely text-based.
Rather than pointing and clicking on menus and buttons, one uses the command line
by typing commands to perform specific tasks.</p>
<p>In part because it is text-based, working with the command line can feel
difficult and intimidating at first, but it is a really awesome tool, and
putting in the time and effort to develop a familiarity with the command line
is well worth the time and effort.  Not only can it look really cool, but using
the command line can be a really efficient way of interacting with your
computer.  After getting used to it, some people even spend almost all of their
time at a command line rather than using graphical programs!</p>
<p>But it's worth noting that when you see someone typing like the wind, flying
around the terminal with ease, keep in mind that their fluency with those tools
is often the result of years or practice (and years of accumulating neat
"tricks" and shortcuts for various operations); just like learning to program,
though, no one is born understanding how the terminal works, and it takes time
and practice to develop that facility.</p>
<p>Part of our hope is that 6.009 can serve to introduce you to some of the basics
of operating a computer via the command line, as a first step on that journey;
and, while we can't cover everything here, we hope that this page can serve as
a brief primer to help you get started by introducing a few of the most
commonly used commands in general, as well as some of the commands you
are likely to use frequently throughout 6.009.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, please also keep in mind that we're here to help (via office
hours and/or via the forum).</p>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_2"></a><a class="anchor" name="_starting_the_terminal"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">2) Starting the Terminal<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_starting_the_terminal">§</a></h2>
<p>Before we can start typing our commands, we need to open a program that will
accept those commands: the terminal.  The exact details of how you open a
terminal, as well as how you interact with it, will vary a little bit depending
on the details of your setup<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_footnote_ref_1"></a><a href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#catsoop_footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>On MacOS, you can open the "Terminal" program (by searching for "Terminal" in Finder, or from Finder-&gt;Applications-&gt;Utilities-&gt;Terminal).</li>
<li>On GNU/Linux, you can open the "Terminal" program (sometimes a keyboard shortcut like <code>Ctrl+Alt+t</code> will open it, or you can search for it).</li>
<li>On Windows, run the "Cygwin Terminal" program (by pressing the Windows key and searching for "Cygwin") after <a href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/info/infrastructure/windows">following our installation instructions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_3"></a><a class="anchor" name="_commands"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">3) Commands<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_commands">§</a></h2>
<p>As the name implies, the command line lets you interact with your computer by
running "commands."  As a basic part of its operation, it also keeps track of
the "working directory," the directory (folder) you're currently in; which will
be important to many of the commands we will use.</p>
<p>When you first open your terminal, you are presented with a <em>prompt</em> (usually
ending with a dollar sign <code>$</code> or an angle bracket <code>&gt;</code>), followed by a blinking
cursor.  This is your indication that the shell is ready to receive a command
from you.</p>
<p>We can think of most commands as consisting of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the program we want to run,</li>
<li>zero or more "options" that change the behavior of the program, and</li>
<li>zero or more "arguments" on which the program should operate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Options and arguments are generally separated by spaces.</p>
<p>Now let's try running our first command.  We'll start small, with a command
consisting just of a program (with no options or arguments).  At the prompt,
type the letters <code>pwd</code> and hit the enter key.</p>
<p>Your computer should respond by printing something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME</code> on MacOS</li>
<li><code>/home/YOUR_USERNAME</code> on GNU/Linux</li>
<li><code>/home/YOUR_USERNAME</code> or <code>/cygdrive/c/Users/YOUR_USERNAME</code> on Cygwin</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the name of your current working directory (<code>pwd</code> stands for
"<b>p</b>rint <b>w</b>orking <b>d</b>irectory").  This is a folder on your
system (that you could navigate to using a graphical interface), and many
commands we run will make use of the fact that we are currently in that folder.</p>
<p>Now let's run a second command (which again consists only of a program, with
no options or arguments).  Try typing <code>ls</code> (that a lower-case L followed by a
lower-case S) and hitting Enter.  As a result, you should see list of the files
and folders contained within the current directory (<code>ls</code> is short for "list").</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_3_1"></a><a class="anchor" name="_notation"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">3.1) Notation<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_notation">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>Often, when you see commands written out in an article, they will include a
dollar sign to indicate the prompt.  For example, a moment ago, we ran the
<code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code> commands.  In many places, those would have been presented as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ pwd
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ ls
</code></pre>
<p>respectively.  Note that when you see something like this, the dollar sign
represents the prompt (it's your indication that what follows is a command to
be typed into a terminal), so you should not type the dollar sign itself into your terminal (only
type the parts that follow the dollar sign).</p>
<p>6.009's assignments will also generally follow this convention when indicating
commands that you should run at your command line.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_4"></a><a class="anchor" name="_arguments"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">4) Arguments<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_arguments">§</a></h2>
<p>Now let's see an example of what happens when we modify the behavior of a
command by specifying an option.  Options generally start with a hyphen <code>-</code>,
and they modify the behavior of a program.</p>
<p>To see an example, let's try running the following command (remember to type
only the piece after the dollar sign! and note that the <code>-l</code> is a hyphen
followed by a lower-case L):</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ ls -l
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-l</code> is an option that tells <code>ls</code> to produce more detailed output.  Here,
instead of seeing only the names of the files and folders, we see some
information about them.  We'll not worry about interpreting that output yet
(feel free to ask on the forum if you are interested), but it includes information
about how large each file is, when it was modified, etc.  For our purposes now,
though, we just want to note that that option changed what the <code>ls</code> program
reported back to us.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_5"></a><a class="anchor" name="_navigating_with_cd"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">5) Navigating with <tt>cd</tt><a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_navigating_with_cd">§</a></h2>
<p>Another command that you will likely use a lot is <code>cd</code> (which stands for
"<b>c</b>hange <b>d</b>irectory").  This command is used to move around your
computer by changing the working directory.</p>
<p>For example, it's likely that the output of the <code>ls</code> program indicated a
subdirectory called <code>Downloads</code>.  If so, and if we run the <code>cd</code> program with
<code>Downloads</code> as an argument, we should see that our working directory changes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ cd Downloads
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your setup, it is likely that the prompt changed to indicate the
current working directory (which is a really nice feature!).  If it didn't,
you can run <code>pwd</code> to see what directory you are in (and maybe consider posting
a message to the forum so we can help you configure your shell to display the
working directory as part of the prompt).</p>
<p>Note that if we now run <code>ls</code>, we should see a list of all of the files and
folders contained within <code>Downloads</code> (with no arguments specified, <code>ls</code> will
always show us the files that are in the current working directory).</p>
<p>You can run the following command to move back up the directory hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ cd ..
</code></pre>
<p>(the <code>..</code> is a special name that refers to the <em>parent</em> of a directory)</p>
<p>You can also move more than one directory at a time.  For example, if we had
a folder called <code>Music</code> inside our <code>Downloads</code> folder, we could get to it by
running <code>cd Downloads</code> followed by <code>cd Music</code>, but we could also get there with
a single command <code>cd Downloads/Music</code> (note the <code>/</code> which is used as a separator).
Similarly, if we were in that directory, running <code>cd ../..</code> would bring us back
(by moving us up two levels in the filesystem).</p>
<p>If you ever get lost in your filesystem, you can also just run <code>cd</code> with no
arguments to return to your "home" directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ cd
</code></pre>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_6"></a><a class="anchor" name="_quick_overview_of_commands_related_to_navigation"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">6) Quick Overview of Commands Related to Navigation<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_quick_overview_of_commands_related_to_navigation">§</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>cd</code> ("<b>c</b>hange <b>d</b>irectory")</p>
<p>Changes the working directory.  If an argument is given, that argument
(if it refers to a valid directory) becomes the working directory.
If no argument is given, the user's "home" directory becomes the working
directory.</p>
<p><code>cd ..</code> moves up one level in the directory hierarchy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pwd</code> ("<b>p</b>rint <b>w</b>orking <b>d</b>irectory")</p>
<p>Prints out the current directory, if you're not sure where you are.</p>
<p>(On a well-configured system, this command is probably not used very often,
as your shell's prompt will typically include information about the
working directory)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ls</code> ("list")</p>
<p>Lists files and folders.  If no argument is given, lists the files in
the current directory.  If an argument is given, lists the files in that
location instead.</p>
<p>The <code>-l</code> option causes <code>ls</code> to print more information (a "long" listing)
for each file.  The <code>-a</code> option ("all") causes <code>ls</code> to show hidden files
(files or directories whose names begin with a period <code>.</code>, which are normally
not shown).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>mv</code> ("move")</p>
<p>Moves or renames a file.  Typical usage involves two arguments, a source
(the file to be moved) and a destination (either a new name for the file, or a
directory into which the file should be moved).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rm</code> ("remove")</p>
<p>Deletes a file given as an argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>mkdir</code> ("make directory")</p>
<p>Creates a new directory.  For example, to create a directory called <code>hello</code>
in the current working directory, run <code>mkdir hello</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_7"></a><a class="anchor" name="_running_python"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">7) Running Python<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_running_python">§</a></h2>
<p>Of course, we are not limited to using the terminal only for navigation!  We
can use it to interact with other programs as well<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_footnote_ref_2"></a><a href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#catsoop_footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; and in 6.009, one of the most common
things we will do in the terminal is to ask Python to run a program we've
written.  <code>python</code> can be specified as the first element of a command just like
any other program.</p>
<p>In a typical lab directory, we have a file called <code>lab.py</code> that contains your
work for the lab.  If you have used <code>cd</code> to navigate to the directory containing
your file, you can run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ python lab.py
</code></pre>
<div class="callout callout-error"><div class="callout-title">Note</div>
<p>On some setups, you may need to type <code>python3</code> instead of <code>python</code>, to
differentiate it from older versions of Python.</p>
</div>
<p>This command will cause Python to run the program you have written in <code>lab.py</code>, including
printing the results of any <code>print</code> statements to the terminal.</p>
<p>Specifying the <code>-i</code> flag will cause Python not to exit after evaluating the
code in the given file, but rather to enter into a "REPL"
(<b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>valuate-<b>P</b>rint-<b>L</b>oop), usually prefaced with
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, where you can type Python commands to interact with objects your program
created.</p>
<p>For example, the following would run the code in your <code>lab.py</code> and then put
you into a Python REPL where all definitions from your <code>lab.py</code> are available:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ python -i lab.py
</code></pre>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_8"></a><a class="anchor" name="_installing_python_packages_with_pip"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">8) Installing Python Packages with Pip<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_installing_python_packages_with_pip">§</a></h2>
<p>While most 6.009 labs will not rely on any software that is not included as
part of Python's "standard library" (i.e., software that is included with a
typical Python installation), we will occasionally make use of additional
packages.  The <code>pip</code> program (included in most Python installations) is used to
install additional packages/modules to your Python environment.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, all of our labs require having the <code>pytest</code> package
installed, for running the test cases we distribute with each lab.  You can
install this with a command like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ pip install pytest
</code></pre>
<div class="callout callout-error"><div class="callout-title">Note</div>
<p>Depending on your environment, you may need to type <code>pip3</code> instead of <code>pip</code>,
and/or you may need to preface the command with <code>sudo</code>.  If you have trouble
with commands like this, please let us know; we're happy to help!</p>
</div>
<p>After running this command, running a Python file containing an <code>import pytest</code>
statement should work without error.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_9"></a><a class="anchor" name="_running_pytest"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">9) Running Pytest<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_running_pytest">§</a></h2>
<p>We will be using <code>pytest</code> as a means of testing the behaviors you implement in
your <code>lab.py</code> files for correctness.  While this can be done from within Python,
it is also useful to learn some things about using <code>pytest</code> as a command to run
the test cases for a given file.</p>
<p>The most direct way to do this is to use <code>cd</code> to navigate to the directory containing your <code>lab.py</code> (and the associated <code>test.py</code>) and to run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">pytest test.py
</code></pre>
<p>This will display some information about which test cases passed and which
failed (a dot indicates a test case that passed, and an F indicates a test case
that failed).</p>
<p>However, <code>pytest</code> is very flexible, and you can customize some details of its
behavior by supplying additional options/arguments.  Some useful examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pytest -v test.py</code> will display more information about the test cases as
they are being run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pytest -x test.py</code> will cause execution to stop after the first failed test
case (if any), rather than running all test cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pytest -s test.py</code> will cause print statements to print to the terminal
immediately as test cases are run (without <code>-s</code>, the output from print
statements is collected and only displayed after running all test cases)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pytest -k PATTERN test.py</code> will run only the test cases that contain
<code>PATTERN</code> in their name.  For example, in lab 0, running <code>pytest -k echo
test.py</code> will cause only the test cases with "echo" in their name to run (in
this case, running only the tests corresponding to that portion of the lab).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These options can also be combined, so, for example, <code>pytest -s -x -k echo
test.py</code> will only run the echo-related tests, exiting after the first error
and displaying the output from <code>print</code> statements during execution rather than
at the end.</p>
<p><code>pytest</code> is a fairly complicated and flexible program, so there are additional
options you can provide; but the examples above are likely to be some of the
most useful as you work on 6.009.</p>

<p>This last section does not introduce any new commands, but it contains some
advice for efficiently navigating using the terminal, as well as some other
hints</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_10_1"></a><a class="anchor" name="_pro_tip_tab_completion"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">10.1) Pro-tip: "Tab Completion"<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_pro_tip_tab_completion">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>Most command lines support a useful feature called "tab completion" that
helps us avoid some of the monotony of typing out long arguments to programs
(often, long filenames).</p>
<p>In the example above, if we had typed only <code>cd Dow</code> and hit the tab key,
your shell will likely fill in the rest of the word <code>Downloads</code> for you!
Making use of tab completion is a good habit to get into, as it really makes
navigating using the terminal a lot more pleasant!</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_10_2"></a><a class="anchor" name="_pro_tip_up_arrow_and_down_arrow_for_navigating_history"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">10.2) Pro-tip: Up-arrow and Down-arrow for Navigating History<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_pro_tip_up_arrow_and_down_arrow_for_navigating_history">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>Often, we want to run the same (or similar) commands repeatedly, one
after the other.  It can be tedious to type the same command multiple times,
so</p>
<p>When faced with an empty prompt, you can use the "up arrow" key to put the
command you just ran back on the command line.  After having done so, you
can edit the command if you want (to fix typos, change arguments, etc),
and you can hit Enter to run it (regardless of whether you edited it).</p>
<p>Hitting the up arrow multiple times will bring up older and older commands.
You can use the up- and down-arrow keys to navigate through the history
of commands you have run, so you won't have to re-type a long command if
you don't want to, even if you ran it a long time ago.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_10_3"></a><a class="anchor" name="_copy_and_paste"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">10.3) Copy and Paste<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_copy_and_paste">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>If you want to paste a command into your command line, or save a command or
its output to a file, you'll want to know how copy and paste work.
If you're using macOS Terminal, <kbd>Command+C</kbd> and <kbd>Command+V</kbd>
(and the Edit menu) will copy and paste as usual.
But on other systems, the usual <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>
shortcuts won't work because, on the command line, these keys have different
meanings.  In particular, <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> <strong>c</strong>ancels (interrupts)
whatever program is currently running, which can be useful
if your <code>python</code> execution has an infinite loop for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>On GNU/Linux, use <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd>
to copy and paste, or use the right-click popup menu.</li>
<li>On Cygwin, selecting text in a Cygwin terminal by default automatically
copies it to your clipboard (no need to explicitly copy it).
To paste text into the terminal, use middle click or the right-click popup
menu, which also lists the associated hotkey <kbd>Shift+Insert</kbd>.
Alternatively, you can set right click to paste under Options / Mouse.</li>
<li>On macOS, use <kbd>Command+C</kbd> and <kbd>Command+V</kbd>
(or the Edit menu) to copy and paste as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_10_4"></a><a class="anchor" name="_filenames_with_spaces"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">10.4) Filenames with Spaces<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/command_line#_filenames_with_spaces">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>As we mentioned above, options and arguments to a program are separated by spaces.
As such, it is usually conventional to avoid putting spaces in filenames,
since this can confuse the terminal (for example, <code>My Documents</code>, when
typed directly into the terminal, would be interpreted as two separate
arguments (<code>My</code> and <code>Documents</code>), rather than as a single entity.</p>
<p>But luckily, there are options for working with arguments that contain
spaces.  One way to handle this is to wrap the argument in quotes <code>"</code>,
for example: <code>cd "My Documents"</code>.</p>
<p>Another way is to add a backslash <code>\</code> in front of each space, for example:
<code>cd My\ Documents</code>.  The backslash tells the comand line that the following
space should be treated as a literal "space" character, rather than as a
separator between two separate arguments.</p>
