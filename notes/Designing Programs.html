<p>It is often the case that experienced programmers are able to envision elegant
solutions to problems before writing any code, whereas beginning programmers
may have a more difficult time.  There is no need to be discouraged by this!
It's important to remember that this has very little to do with intrinsic
talent or ability; it's all about experience, and it's a skill that can be
learned (although it takes lots of time and practice!).</p>
<p>In part, experienced programmers are able to arrive at correct, efficient
solutions more quickly because experienced developers have more "tools in their
toolbox," so to speak; by having seen and solved more problems, they have a
larger collection of past experience upon which to draw for experience.  One of
the things we'll try to do in 6.009 is to expose you to a variety of different
problems (as well as specific techniques to solve different kinds of problems),
in an effort to help you build up that collection of experiences as well.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_2"></a><a class="anchor" name="_a_general_framework_for_program_design"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">2) A General Framework for Program Design<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/design#_a_general_framework_for_program_design">§</a></h2>
<p>Beyond the specific experiences one acquires with time, it can also be helpful
to have in mind a general framework for thinking about designing programs.</p>
<p>In order to make this process as smooth and efficient as possible, it is a good
idea to <strong>avoid the temptation to write code until you have a plan in mind</strong>.
We all know from experience that it can be tempting to start writing code
immediately when presented with a new problem, but spending a little bit of
time constructing a plan and designing a solution can save a lot of time and
heartache down the line.</p>
<p>Some people like to formalize this more or less than others, but one way to
think about the process is to break it down into the four steps outlined in
the following sections (inspired by George Pólya's wonderful book, <em>How To
Solve It</em> (Princeton University Press, 1945), which some regard as the best
book ever written about teaching and problem solving).</p>
<p>Note that a big part of this outline is about breaking a big problem down into
smaller, more manageable pieces (which can often be implemented and tested
independently).</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that following this process still does not necessarily
make formulating a plan for any given program <em>easy</em> in an absolute sense, but
the hope is that it makes the process <em>easier</em> than it otherwise would be; and,
over time, the process will become second nature, but for now it can still be very
helpful to work through the outline below in detail every time you design and
implement a program.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_2_1"></a><a class="anchor" name="_understand_the_problem"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">2.1) Understand the Problem<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/design#_understand_the_problem">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>An important first step in designing a program to solve a problem is making
sure you actually understand the problem you're trying to solve.  As such, a
good place to start is by asking yourself questions such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problem are you trying to solve?</li>
<li>What is the input, and what is the output?  How can we represent these in Python?</li>
<li>What are some example input/output relationships?  Come up with a few small, specific examples you can use to test later.
<ul>
<li>How do you, a human, solve those simple cases?  Do those steps generalize?  How can we break that down into steps small enough for the computer to understand?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_2_2"></a><a class="anchor" name="_make_a_plan"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">2.2) Make A Plan<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/design#_make_a_plan">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of the problem in mind, it is time to formulate
a plan by asking yourself questions such as the following (and, indeed, it is a
good idea to think through this before writing any code):</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for the connection between the input and the output.  What are the high-level operations that need to be performed to produce the output?  How can you construct the output using those operations?  How can you test the operations?</li>
<li>What information, beyond the inputs, will you need to keep track of?  What types of Python objects are useful ways to represent that information?</li>
<li>Have you read or written a related program before?  If so, pieces of that solution might be helpful here.</li>
<li>Can you break the problem down into simpler cases?  If you can't immediately solve the proposed problem, try first solving a subpart of the problem, or a related but simpler problem (sometimes, a more general or more specific case).</li>
<li>Does your plan make use of all the inputs?  Does it produce all the proper outputs?</li>
<li>Thinking back to your understanding of the problem, are there any interesting "edge cases" that should be considered?  Does your plan account for those?</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_2_3"></a><a class="anchor" name="_implement_the_plan"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">2.3) Implement the Plan<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/design#_implement_the_plan">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>It is only after understanding the problem and formulating a plan that it makes
sense to start putting that plan into action by translating it into Python
code, and it can be helpful to consider the following as you are doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may be able to implement several of the important high-level operations as individual "helper" functions.</li>
<li>As you are going, consider the style guidelines outlined <a href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/style">here</a>.  If you find yourself repeating a computation, you may want to reorganize now (rather than at the end).</li>
<li>As you are going, check each step and each helper function:
<ul>
<li>Can you clearly see that the step is correct in a general sense?</li>
<li>Can you prove that it is correct in a general sense?</li>
<li>Does the step pass your test cases from earlier?</li>
<li>How can you use that result as part of the larger program?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_2_4"></a><a class="anchor" name="_look_back"></a></p><h3 class="cs_section_title">2.4) Look Back<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/design#_look_back">§</a></h3><p></p>
<p>When you are reasonably certain that you are finished, it is still worth taking
a step back, so to speak, and looking at things again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test both for correctness and style.</li>
<li>For each of the test cases you constructed earlier, run it and make sure you see the result you expect.  Are there other test cases you should consider?</li>
<li>Could you have solved the problem a different way?  If so, what are the benefits and drawbacks of the solution you chose?</li>
<li>Can you use the result for some other problem?  Can you use similar programming structures for some other problem?</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to improve the style of your code according to the rules discussed in the previous section.
<ul>
<li>Are the names of your functions and variables concise and descriptive?</li>
<li>Are you repeating a computation anywhere?</li>
<li>Are there functions or other pieces of your code that could be generalized?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_3"></a><a class="anchor" name="_organizing_the_design_process"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">3) Organizing the Design Process<a class="cs_permalink" href="https://py.mit.edu/spring22/notes/design#_organizing_the_design_process">§</a></h2>
<p>Even when following the suggestions above, it is not always apparent how one
should organize the process.  And there is no real right answer, but many
people find it helpful to do one or more of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sketch out a high-level outline on paper, in any format that is helpful to
you.  This can involve working through specific cases by hand, outlining
useful helper functions, drawing diagrams, writing "pseudocode," or
anything else that is helpful to you.</p>
<p>It is often the case that, walking by an experienced programmer's office as
they are working, you will find papers (or whiteboards or chalkboards) full
of diagrams, code outlines, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicitly write an outline using comments.  Particularly once the high-level
design starts to take shape a bit, it can be helpful to organize your
thoughts using comments in an actual Python file, even before writing any
actual code.</p>
<p>For example, you might start by writing functions that are empty except for
doctsrings detailing their behavior.  From there, you might write comments
within those functions that mirror the structure you expect your code will
eventually take, outlining high-level steps that need to be taken.  That
way, when it comes time to actually implement the plan, you already have a
high-level plan explicitly written out, and you can think about writing
smaller pieces of code at a time, since the comments have hopefully broken
things down a bit for you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
